# 📊 Investment Tracking Application

## 📌 About The Project
Investment Tracking Application is a console-based finance management tool developed using Python.

This project allows users to record their investments, categorize them, and calculate the total amount invested in specific assets.

The main purpose of this project was to practice:
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- User input handling
- Conditional logic
- Basic financial tracking logic

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new investment records
- List all recorded investments
- Calculate total investment by category
- Simple and interactive console menu
- Continuous loop system until user exit

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Loop structures
- Conditional statements

## ▶️ How It Works
1. User selects an option from the menu.
2. Investments are stored in a list as dictionary objects.
3. The program calculates totals dynamically.
4. Data remains active during runtime.
